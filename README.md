# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

issues:
- vite version 7 dependencies issue with tailwind

how i approached
- planned out scope
- spun up basic react + vite + tailwind app which took quite a while because of dependencies issues between new vite version and tailwind
- codebase structure setup
- created all my pages and set up routing using react router
- home page fetch and display
